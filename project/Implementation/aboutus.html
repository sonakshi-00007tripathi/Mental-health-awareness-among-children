            <p class="text-xl leading-loose font-medium text-gray-100">
                Children's mental health is often overlooked due to the lack of regular assessments and monitoring.
                Early identification of potential issues can lead to timely interventions, ensuring that children receive
                the support they need before problems escalate. Our project aims to bridge this gap by developing an advanced
                <span class="text-yellow-300 font-bold">Mental Health Surveillance & Assessment Tool</span> that continuously tracks children's
                emotional well-being, using AI-driven analysis, behavioral tracking, and data-driven insights to detect
                early warning signs and provide actionable recommendations. With this technology, parents, teachers, and healthcare professionals
                can work together to create a nurturing and supportive environment for every child.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
                    We envision a world where every child’s mental health is actively monitored, prioritized, and cared for.
                    By integrating technology with mental health assessment methodologies, we aim to reduce stigma,
                    encourage early intervention, and foster a culture where mental well-being is valued as much as physical health.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
                    Our platform uses artificial intelligence to assess children's mental health through interactive assessments,
                    behavioral pattern recognition, and real-time monitoring. By analyzing data trends and emotional indicators,
                    our system can identify children who may be struggling and provide tailored recommendations to caregivers,
                    educators, and healthcare professionals to ensure they receive the help they need.
